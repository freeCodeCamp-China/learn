The value of v depends on y0 and y1 as follows:"," If y0 = y1, the value of v equals y0."," If y0 ≠ y1, the value of v equals (y1 - y0) / (ln(y1) - ln(y0)).","","The left image is one of the possible paths for d = 4. First the ant goes from A(0, 1) to P1(1, 3) at velocity (3 - 1) / (ln(3) - ln(1)) ≈ 1.8205. Then the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 ≈ 1.2283.","From P1(1, 3) to P2(3, 3) the ant travels at velocity 3 so the required time is 2 / 3 ≈ 0.6667. From P2(3, 3) to B(4, 1) the ant travels at velocity (1 - 3) / (ln(1) - ln(3)) ≈ 1.8205 so the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 ≈ 1.2283.","Thus the total required time is 1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233.","","","The right image is another path. The total required time is calculated as 0.98026 + 1 + 0.98026 = 2.96052. It can be shown that this is the quickest path for d = 4.","","","","Let F(d) be the total required time if the ant chooses the quickest path. For example, F(4) ≈ 2.960516287.","We can verify that F(10) ≈ 4.668187834 and F(100) ≈ 9.217221972.","","","Find F(10000).
