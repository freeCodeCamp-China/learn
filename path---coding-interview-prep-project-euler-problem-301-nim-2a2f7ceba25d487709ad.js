To illustrate:","- current player moves to (1,2,1)","- opponent moves to (1,0,1)","- current player moves to (0,0,1)","- opponent moves to (0,0,0), and so wins.","","For how many positive integers n ≤ 230 does X(n,2n,3n) = 0 ?"],challengeType:5,fields:{slug:"/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-301-nim",blockName:"Project Euler",tests:[{text:"<code>euler301()</code> should return 2178309.",testString:"assert.strictEqual(euler301(), 2178309, '<code>euler301()</code> should return 2178309.');"}]},required:[],files:{indexhtml:null,indexjs:{key:"indexjs",ext:"js",name:"index",contents:"function euler301() {\n  // Good luck!\n  return true;\n}\n\neuler301();",head:"",tail:""},indexjsx:null}}},pathContext:{challengeMeta:{introPath:"",template:null,required:[],nextChallengePath:"/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-302-strong-achilles-numbers",id:"5900f4991000cf542c50ffab"},slug:"/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-301-nim"}}}});
